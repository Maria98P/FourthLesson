                <ul>
                    <li> 170 g all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li> 20 g granulated sugar</li>
                    <li> 6 g yeast</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon(s) baking soda</li>
                    <li>1 vanilla powder</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon(s) salt</li>
                    <li>300 g whole milk, lukewarm</li>
                    <li>1 egg, medium</li>
                    <li>60 g butter, melted</li>
                    <li>butter, or sunflower oil spray (for the waffle maker)</li>

                <p> Put the flour, sugar, yeast, baking soda, vanilla powder, and salt into a bowl, and whisk them well. 
                    Add the milk, egg, and butter, and whisk them well until completely combined and until you have a thin batter.
                    Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the batter rise at room temperature for 1 ½-2 hours or until it doubles in size. (The waiting time depends on how warm the room where you have the bowl is.)
                    Preheat the waffle maker to medium-high temperature.
                    Spray the whole surface of the waffle maker with butter or sunflower oil.
                    Pour one ladleful of the batter onto the waffle maker, covering ¾ of its capacity.
                    Close the waffle maker and cook the waffle for 4-5 minutes, until it is nicely golden and crispy. 
                    Remove the waffle and transfer it to a wire rack to cool.
                    Follow the same process for the rest of the batter. (In total, you will have 5-6 waffles.)
                    Serve the waffles with ice cream, chocolate hazelnut spread, chocolate wafers, and chocolate pearls. </p>
